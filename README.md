This is a simple web application that allows you to choose the color of your text and generate the corresponding HTML code to be used in your Tumblr posts.

## How to Use

1. Enter the text you want to format in the text area provided
2. Choose the color you want using the color picker
3. Click the "Generate" button to generate the HTML code
4. Copy the generated code and paste it into your Tumblr post

## Limitations

- The generated HTML code only works for text within a single paragraph (i.e., no line breaks or multiple paragraphs)
- The generated HTML code only sets the color of the text, not any other text formatting (e.g., font size, bold, italic)
